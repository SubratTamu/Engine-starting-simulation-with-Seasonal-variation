Project1-Engine Starting.mo [ Uploaded in Github]

In order to find starting SOC for summer and winter season,

Run Project1 -> discharge lights for a period of 7200 seconds, using fixed temperature values 
of 25 C for summer and -10 C for winter. 
This was done prior to running the model and the SOC values have already been initialized in the 
corresponding models (Summer and Winter).

For Summer:
  Please run:
       Project1->Summer.mo


For Winter:
   Please run:
       Project1->Winter.mo
